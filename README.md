#  Multithreaded Web Server in Java

A custom-built HTTP Web Server developed using Java Socket Programming and ExecutorService-based thread pooling. This server can handle multiple concurrent client requests, serve static HTML files, and simulates the functionality of a basic HTTP server.



##  Features

-  Handles 1000+ concurrent requests using a fixed-size thread pool
-  Implements Java multithreading with `ExecutorService`
-  Serves static HTML files with correct HTTP response formatting
-  Load-tested using Apache JMeter and Apache Benchmark (ab) tools
-  Organized request logging for better visibility and debugging



##  Tech Stack

- Java 8+
- Socket Programming
- ExecutorService (Thread Pool)
- Apache JMeter (for load testing)
- HTTP 1.1 Protocol (basic support)
